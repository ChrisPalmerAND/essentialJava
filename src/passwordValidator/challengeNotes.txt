I didn't because it's an exercise but possibly should have put validation rules into their own class.

Then called a validation method, and also received an error message to display to the user.

Then the validation can be re used and not just for passwords.

Also should have had a separate method for actually changing the password and not had it lumped in with the validation.

Next step would also be to

 - Find a way to not have to loop through the length of the array if it is false.
 - Loop it so it doesn't explode if you put the wrong password in
